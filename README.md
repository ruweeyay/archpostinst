# bash
arch post-installation script.
This script was made for personal use and just for some fun. If you need it for some reason I'll be glad it helped someone.
ATTENTION: if you are going to use it you shoudld know - this is a testing version and may have some bugs or errors. Also, script is unfinished, so it's VERY case sensetive now, so be carefull with answers when you have to choose. Write exactly what is displayer in [ ] (e.g. [y\n], [mesa nvidia] etc).
I'll make some improvements later.
